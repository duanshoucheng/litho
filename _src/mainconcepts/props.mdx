The [Components](components-basics.mdx) page details how to declare a component and its **props** as standard `val` properties. This page covers two more ways for a parent component to configure its children with props: [Common props](#common-props) and [Tree props](#tree-props).

## Common Props

:::note
A common prop is one of a set of properties that can be applied to any primitive component.
:::

Common props are supported by all primitive components. They include View properties like `onClick` and `background`, visibility events like `onVisible`, as well as layout parameters like `margin`.

Common props are specified using the `Style` API, which enables one or more common props to be chained together into a Style object that is passed to the components as a prop, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin
val style = Style.margin(all = 4.px)
    .backgroundColor(Color.RED)
    .viewTag("my_view")
```

For a component to be configured with a Style, it should declare a Style prop (such as `val style: Style? = null`). It should then pass that Style object to one of the components it renders to, usually the root component it returns from `render`. In this way, the Style will eventually end up on a primitive component (for example, `Text` or `Row)`. All common props end up being materialized by primitive components, as shown in the following example:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/HelloComponent.kt start=start_styled_example end=end_styled_example
```

### Combining a Style from above with a local Style

The following 'more advanced' example shows how you can combine a Style taken from above with the Style the component itself wants to define:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ChildStylesExample.kt start=start_combine_style_example end=end_combine_style_example
```

### Working with Style

In the above example, you may have noticed the use of `+` to combine the Style passed from `OuterTextComponent` and the styles that `InnerTextComponent` defines. The `+` operator combines two Styles into a single Style without mutating either:

```kotlin
val alphaStyle = Style.alpha(1f)
val combinedStyle = alphaStyle + Style.padding(all = 8.dp).margin(all = 8.dp)

// Result:
//   alphaStyle: (alpha: 1f)
//   combinedStyle: (alpha: 1f) <- (padding-all: 8.dp) <- (margin-all: 8.dp)
```

Note that ordering around `+` matters: if a Style property is defined twice, the **last** definition takes precendence:

```kotlin
val alphaStyle = Style.alpha(1f)
val combinedStyle = alphaStyle + Style.padding(all = 8.dp).alpha(.5f)

// Result:
//   combinedStyle will apply padding of 8.dp and alpha of .5f
```

Generally, `Style` objects are immutable: any time you combine styles or add new properties to a style, you get a new `Style` instance that contains all the properties of the previous style plus the new properties.

### Java - Kotlin compatibility

If you need to pass down a style from a Java class to a Kotlin component, use `StyleCompat`:

```java file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/OuterStyleComponentSpec.java start=start_combine_style_outer_example end=end_combine_style_outer_example
```

For passing style from Kotlin code to a Java Spec component, you can use `.kotlinStyle()`, which is equivalent to setting all the common props the `Style` defines:

```kotlin file=sample/src/main/java/com/facebook/samples/litho/kotlin/documentation/ChildStylesExample.kt start=start_combine_java_kotlin_style_example end=end_combine_java_kotlin_style_example
```

- **[Tree Props](treeprops.mdx)** - provides a way to give access to contextual objects, like a theme or logging utility, to all components in a sub-tree without having to manually pass them.
